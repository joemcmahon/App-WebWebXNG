*** WebWebX's architecture HAS CHANGED. 
*** Just copying these files over to your current installation WILL BREAK IT.

WebWebX is an open-source text-based Web collaboration server. To say that
more concisely, it's a "whiteboard" hosted on a website. All users of the
website can edit and create pages within that website, and link to any 
resource throughout the internet.

WebWebX is based on WikiWiki and WebWeb; it adds a lot of features designed
to make it easier to administer and easier to use.
