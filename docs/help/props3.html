<h4>Options</h4>

The owner of the page, and the web administrator have access to
a number of options which other users with modify access do not.
These options affect the basic behaviour of the page. <p>

<dl>

<dt>Locking a page
<dd>The page owner can lock a page so that only they can have
	access at any level. This can be used if the owner wants
	to update important information and wants to disable
	access temporarily. <p>

<dt>Making a page sticky
<dd>When a new page is created it inherits the access control
	lists of the page the edit was initiated from. If this
	page was <em>sticky</em> then all of the properties
	are inherited, including the page's author. <p>

	This can be used to control access to a 'tree' of pages,
	though it should be noted that there are ways round
	sticky pages. For example the target can be created from
	another non-sticky page. However this option is provided
	more for convenience than security. <p>
