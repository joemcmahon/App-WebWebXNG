<H4>Registration and signing in</H4>

<P>WebWeb is set up to allow access to all users in the <TT>stx.com</TT> and <TT>gsfc.nasa.gov</TT> domains, and to exclude all others. To further secure the server, we've also set it up so that it's necessary to log in with a user ID and password. Users who don't choose to sign in can view pages and follow links, but they will not be able to edit pages.</P>

<p>If you want to be able to log in to the system, you'll need to use the registration page to create a new user ID for yourself.  After you're registered, you can click on the "Sign in" link and sign in using your registered user ID. You'll then be able to access all of WebWeb's functions, including editing pages.</p>

<p>Until you've registered, you'll be "signed in" be default as user "anonymous".
