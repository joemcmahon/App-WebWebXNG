<h4>Properties</h4>

Each page has a list of properties besides its content which
determines the operation you can perform upon it. Each page
has
<UL>
<li>an owner
<li>three access control lists for viewing, editing and internal modification, 
<li>various flags for setting archiving, email notification, and so on.
</UL>
These properties
can be accessed by clicking on the properties icon (or "Properties" link, if icons are turned off): <p>

If you do not own a page, then you may be restricted from
modifying its internal properties, from editing its contents
or even from viewing it at all, subject to the owner's desires. The WebWeb administrator always has access to all pages. <p>

<h4>Page information</h4>

If you do not have access to the page's properties you can
still find out about the page by clicking on the page information
icon (or the "Information" link, if icons are off): <p>

<img src="../icons/info.gif"> <p>

This will tell you who owns the page, when it was created and
last edited, and its revision number (which indicates how much
it has been edited in the past). If the page has any sort of access
control in operation then this will be outlined. <p>

If the page owner and web administrator have submitted their
email addresses then you will also be given the chance to email
them. <p>
