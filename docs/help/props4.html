<dt>Toggling archiving
<dd>Page archiving can be toggled on and off. If an archive exists
	and page archiving is turned off then the page's revision
	will not increase so that it is kept in sync with the
	archive. Anything currently in the archive will be retained, but no
    new archive entries will be made. <p>

<dt>Toggling email notification
<dd>Email notification for the page can be toggled on and off. This
	is useful if a heavy discussion is going on, since potentially
	many emails could be sent out in a short space of time. The WebWeb
    administrator controls the frequency with which notifications will
    be sent.<p>

<dt>Changing ownership
<dd>The page owner can cede ownership by typing a new username into
	the <em>owner</em> property. There is currently no check for a 
    valid user name here. Be careful; you will have to get the 
    WebWeb administrator to fix this if you enter a bad name.
