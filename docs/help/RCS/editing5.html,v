<h4>Page locking and unlocking</h4>

You will note that when you select a page for editing, you will see a 
message that looks like this at the bottom of the page:
<blockquote>
<address>Being edited by SomeUser from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn since Thu Jan 21 11:02:14 1999 </address>
</blockquote>
This message lets you know that you have the page locked; no one else may edit 
it until either
<ul>
<li>you save the page
<li>You click on the "Break Edit Lock" entry in the command bar
<li>Someone else with edit access to the page clicks on the "Break Edit Lock"
entry in the command bar
</ul>
If you access a page that is currently being edited by someone else, you will 
see a similar message across the bottom of the page.
<p>
Note that breaking someone else's lock should be done only in a circumstance
when you know that the other person is not editing the page or accidentally 
left the page locked (e.g., by leaving the edit page without saving or
breaking their own lock). Breaking a lock can lead to a race condition where
something like the following happens:
<ol>
<li>UserOne starts editing SamplePage, locking it.
<li>UserTwo gets impatient and breaks the lock on SamplePage and starts editing
it.
<li>UserOne saves SamplePage.
<li>UserTwo saves SamplePage.
<li>UserOne looks at SamplePage and wonders where the edits went. (They're actually in the previous, archived version of the page.)
</ol>
Bottom line: Don't break a lock unless you know that the locking user isn't at
his/her tube, editing.
