<h4>Registering your email address</h4>

As your first task, you should register your email
address with the system. Click on the edit email icon
in the toolbar at the left side of the page. It looks
like this: <p>

<img src="../icons/editmail.gif"> <p>

If icons have been turned off by the administrator, this will be replaced by a link reading "Set My Email Address".

You will be asked to type in your email address. If your
email address ever changes, you can edit your entry by clicking
on the "edit email" icon/link again. <p>

<h4>Adding your name to a notification list</h4>

If you are interested in a particular page you can register
with it. Whenever the page is changed you will receive
an email (sent to your registered email address) telling you
about the change. <p>

Clicking on the notification icon will toggle your interest. To
prevent accidental toggling you will be asked to confirm your
decision. The notification icon looks like this: <p>

<img src="../icons/mail.gif"> <p>

If icons are turned off, the "Set Mail Notification" link in the toolbar does the same thing.
