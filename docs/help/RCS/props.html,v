<h4>Access control lists</h4>

Normally, all pages are completely open to access by any WebWeb user; these
pages may be edited, renamed, deleted - anything, by any user. You can use
access control lists to change this, limiting who can do what to any given 
page.

There are three access control lists: read, edit and modify. The
read list gives users permission to read the contents of the page.
The edit list gives users permission to edit the contents of the
page but nothing else. The modify lists gives users permission
to modify the page's properties, and to copy, rename or delete the
page. <p>

The access lists are hierarchical, so a user with edit access also
has read access, and a user with modify access also has read and
edit access. <p>

<ul>
<li>If left blank (the default), every user in the system has access at that level.
<li>A single <em>hypen</em> indicates that <I>no</I> users have access at that
	level.
<li>A comma or space separated list of usernames will allow those
	users access, but no others.
<li>If a name on the list starts with a <em>plus sign</em> then it
	is interpreted as an <em>access control page</em> (see the
	next help page).
<li>The page owner and the web administrator automatically have full
	access.
</ul> <p>
