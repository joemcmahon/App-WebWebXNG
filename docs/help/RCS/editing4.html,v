<h4>Good style tips</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Signed and unsigned pages
<dd>If a page, or a part of a page is signed by an author then you
	should treat their words with respect. If you want to add
	comments you should append them rather than editing the
	original text. If pages are not signed you can think of them
	as being more collaberative. <p>

<dt>Citations versus external references
<dd>External references naturally draw more attention than citations
	since they take up more space on the page. For this reason
	you should only mention full URLs if the page is of significant
	interest, or if you want to make a distinction about the
	protocol. Although citations can be associated with any
	protocol, users will normally assume the HTTP protocol and
	expect a web page - they may be surprised if their news reader
	is launched instead. <p>

<dt>Unanswered questions and new ideas
<dd>If you have a question or a subject area you are unsure about, you
	can mention it as a page reference. Another user with more
	detailed knowledge can then fill in the blanks. This leads to
	a different way of writing down ideas - you can leave trailing
	references to unknown information and tangents which you, or
	someone else, can beef up later. <p>
