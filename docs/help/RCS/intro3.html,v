<h4>Possible Uses</h4>

Like the original WikiWikiWeb, this program is designed to
support collaboration. Many high-level conventions exist within
WikiWikiWeb which impose a structure on information as it is
added to the database. Hopefully, WebWeb gives users the tools
to impose a finer degree of control on this process, rather
than unneccessarily hindering them. <p>

<dl>

<dt>Chat System
<dd>WebWeb can behave like an asynchronous chat system, existing
	somewhere between threaded newsgroups and mailing lists.
	The possibility of using special formatting rules and
	including images should brighten up the proceedings. <p>

<dt>Tutorial Server
<dd>WebWeb's added security can limit access to a page, or group of
	pages, to a particular set of people. Access control
	can be used to allow a subset of the group to edit pages
	and a select few 'administrators' to manage the overall
	structure. For example: <p>

	<ul>
	<li>Students could write up their opinions, making them
		world-readable, but allowing their tutor to add
		comments and make changes.
	<li>Smaller groups can have private, or moderated discussions
		which can be as open or as closed as desired.
	</ul> <p>
