<h4>Restoring pages</h4>

A particular archived version of the page can be restored, with
the current version being added to the archive, by clicking 
on the restore icon: <p>

<img src="../icons/restore.gif"> <p>

Since the contents of the page is being replaced, you need to
have edit access before you are allowed to restore an archived
page. <p>

<h4>Purging a page archive</h4>

An archive can be cleaned out completely by clicking on the
purge icon: <p>

<img src="../icons/purge.gif"> <p>

This will delete all versions of the page other than the most recent one.

You need to have modify access before you are allowed to purge
a page's archive. <p>
