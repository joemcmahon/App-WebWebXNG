<h4>How to edit a page</h4>

You can edit a page by clicking on the edit button. This displays
an editing area where you can alter the contents of the page, plus
a "Save" button. Clicking on the "Save" button moves the current contents
into the page's archive and puts your edited content in its place: <p>

<img src="../icons/edit.gif"> <p>

(The "Edit" toolbar entry corresponds to this icon when icons are off.)

You can edit all of the citations and links within a page by clicking on the
"Edit links" icon/link. This will highlight all of the citations. Clicking
on them will display the associated URL which you can edit and
save. This option also changes the internal references in the page so
that clicking on them edits the referred page: <p>

<img src="../icons/links.gif"> <p>

You will see an "Edit Links" entry in the toolbar instead if icons are turned off.

<h4>Adding references</h4>

<ul>
<li>Mentioning a WebWeb page by name automatically creates a
	reference to that page. 
<li>Mentioning a full URL will be hyperlinked automatically.
<li>Citations can be used to insert links to URLs tidily (see
	the formatting rules, next).
<li>From time to time, you'll find that you may need to enter
    something that looks like a WebWeb page name, but you
    don't want WebWeb to make it into a link (this happens
    a lot if you're documenting Perl or Java code). Put
    two <b>backquotes</b> in front of it to keep WebWeb
    from interpreting it, like so:
<pre>
        ``NotToBeLinked
</pre>
</ul>
