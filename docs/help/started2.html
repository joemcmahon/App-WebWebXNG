<h4>Navigating</h4>

The easiest way to navigate through a WebWeb is to click on
whatever internal references appear on the pages you are
viewing. You can also obtain a list of "all of the pages
which reference the current document" by clicking on the
<em>view references</em> icon: <p>

<img src="../icons/viewrefs.gif"> <p>

(Use the "View Refs" link in the toolbar if icons are turned off.)

Sometimes webs will have a search page which will allow you
to search through all of the pages for a specific sub-string.
You can also click on the search icon (or "Search All Pages" link, if icons are turned off): <p>

<img src="../icons/search.gif"> <p>

Once you are using WebWeb on a regular basis, you might want to
see only the pages that have recently been updated. The "recent
changes" icon (or "Recent Changes" link in the toolbar, if icons are off) takes you to such a list: <p>

<img src="../icons/changes.gif"> <p>

<a href="started.html"><img src="left.gif" border=0></a>
<a href="started3.html"><img src="right.gif" border=0></a> <p>
<a href="index.html"><img src="line.gif" alt="Back" border=0></a> <p>
</center>
