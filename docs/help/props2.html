<h4>Access control pages</h4>

Access control pages can be used to define large groups of 
people that should have similar access rights to different
WebWeb pages. An access control page can be added to any access
control list simply by preceding its name with a <em>plus
sign</em>. <p>

<h4>Structure of an access control page</h4>

An access control page behaves like any other page. However any
lines beginning with a <em>plus sign</em> are interpreted as
lists of users which are to be added to the access control
list which mentions the page. <p>

<ul>
<li>Access control pages can reference themselves, giving
	a self-maintainable list of users.
<li>A page can reference itself in its access control lists.
	This does not produce a recursive search, and is perfectly
	safe.
</ul> <p>

Any access control pages can be reached quickly by looking at
the page information. Any access control pages mentioned in
the access control lists will be hyperlinked automatically. <p>
