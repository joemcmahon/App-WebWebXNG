<h4>WebWeb Pages</h4>

WebWeb is an easy-to-use system which allows multiple users to
share simple text pages over the web. The pages can contain
special controls which create emphasised text, bulleted lists and
so on. <p>

Pages can easily refer to other pages within the system. When
a page is mentioned by name in the contents of another page,
the system automatically creates a hyperlink to it. This is called
an <em>internal reference</em>. <p>

Other web pages can be referred to in two different ways. When a
URL is found within the contents of a page, the system creates
an <em>external reference</em>. However, a tidier and more formal
way of referring to external pages is though <em>citations</em>.
A citation is a word enclosed in square brackets which can be
associated with a URL.  If any images (GIF or JPEG) are referred
to by either method, they are automatically inlined. <p>
