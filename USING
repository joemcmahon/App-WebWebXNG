LOGGING IN
Click the "Sign In" button. The browser will pop up a dialog asking for your
user id and password (this is your WebWebX user id and password, not the one
you logged in with!).

Since WebWebX uses the basic authorization feature of HTTP, your password is
not safe against sniffing. Use a secure Web server if you want to get around
that problem.

EDITING PAGES
Click on the "Edit Page" link to get a scrolling textbox containing the
page text. WebWebX uses a simplified markup language to make it harder to 
include nasties like evil Javascript, etc.

If you decide you don't want to edit the page, click on the "Break Edit Lock"
link. Otherwise, make your changes and click on save. You'll see an updated
version of the page.
